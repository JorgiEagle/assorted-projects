06 p.m. UTCAmid a contentious hearing over proposed restrictions on Arizona’s vo
te-by-mail system, a Republican state lawmaker argued that voters who hadn’t par
ticipated in recent elections should no longer automatically have absentee ballo
ts mailed to them. The reasoning, said state Rep. John Kavanagh (R), is that Rep
ublicans care more about alleged voter fraud than Democrats — and that “everybod
y shouldn’t be voting.”Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right“Democ
rats value as many people as possible voting, and they’re willing to risk fraud.
 Republicans are more concerned about fraud, so we don’t mind putting security m
easures in that won’t let everybody vote — but everybody shouldn’t be voting,” h
e told CNN this week.Then, despite no evidence presented of dead people voting o
r residents using absentee ballots that weren’t their own in Arizona, the longti
me lawmaker insisted the proposed voting measures in the state, like the hundred
s of others in states nationwide this year, reflected how “quality” mattered jus
t as much “quantity.”ADAD“Not everybody wants to vote, and if somebody is uninte
rested in voting, that probably means that they’re totally uninformed on the iss
ues,” Kavanagh said to the outlet. “Quantity is important, but we have to look a
t the quality of votes, as well.”His comments have drawn the ire of voting right
s experts and critics who accused the Republican of using rhetoric “straight out
 of Jim Crow,” as author Ari Berman said, at a time when GOP-controlled legislat
ures are advocating stricter voting measures across the United States. The push 
from Republicans comes on the heels of former president Donald Trump promoting b
aseless claims of voter fraud without evidence for months.How to tell if you are
 casting a ‘quality’ voteSo far, more than 250 bills on voting restrictions have
 been introduced in state legislatures nationwide in 2021, according to data com
piled by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. In Arizona, wher
e close to 80 percent of voters cast their ballots by mail in the last election,
 the state government has already introduced 24 bills restricting voting rights 
this year.Following Democratic victories in the 2020 election, state Republican 
lawmakers across the country are proposing new laws that would restrict access t
o voting. (Mahlia Posey/The Washington Post)This week alone, the Arizona Senate 
approved a bill that would require voters to submit identification as part of th
eir mail-in ballots. That was before a state House committee headed by Kavanagh 
approved the measure on Wednesday to stop mailing ballots to people who haven’t 
voted in the past four elections.ADADKavanagh’s comments were denounced by votin
g rights expert Gloria Browne-Marshall, a constitutional law professor at John J
ay College of Criminal Justice, as voter suppression that uses “language from th
e 1800s” in response to the election.“When we see states like Arizona that have 
wanted to suppress the right to vote and found different ways to manipulate law 
and violence, it’s a slap in the face to democracy at its core,” said Browne-Mar
shall, the author of “The Voting Rights War: The NAACP and the Ongoing Struggle 
for Justice.” “This is just another level of American hypocrisy.”In an interview
 on Friday, Kavanagh said his words were taken out of context and defended the m
easure to stop sending some voters mail-in ballots as a matter of election secur
ity. He told The Post that his sentiment about “everybody shouldn’t be voting” w
as referencing “those fraudulent voters, not less-informed people who have every
 right to vote.”ADAD“I would never support a voter information test to vote,” he
 said to The Post. “If you can legally vote, you vote. But I don’t think people 
who are disinterested should be forced to the polls in the interest of turnout.”
President Biden on March 7 signed an executive order aimed at promoting voting r
ights as sate legislatures consider measures that could limit voting access. (Th
e White House)Kavanagh said the concerns surrounding fraudulent voters have been
 anecdotal. A Post analysis last year of votes cast in three states with all-mai
l elections found the rate of suspicious ballots cast in 2016 and 2018 to be 0.0
025 percent of the total.Browne-Marshall said that elected officials alleging or
 suggesting that dead people voted is “a racial tactic to suppress voters of col
or.”“The slew of proposed voting laws in Arizona and across the country isn’t ab
out voter fraud, because it simply doesn’t exist,” wrote Arizona Republic column
ist Elvia Díaz. “It’s about keeping certain people from voting.”ADADCritics this
 week latched onto the term “quality” vote. Michael Waldman, president of the Br
ennan Center, said the “not very subtle subtext” of a quality vote means White v
oters.“These remarks have a long, very ugly history in America,” Waldman said. “
When you say something like this, it’s about race or class — not quality or elec
tion integrity.”The language used in Arizona is not new when it comes to promoti
ng voting restrictions. As The Post’s Philip Bump has explained, the idea that s
ome people are simply too ignorant to vote has a toxic history — one rooted in i
ntelligence and literacy tests that were central to limiting Black people from v
oting in the Jim Crow South.ADThe rhetoric has also been used in recent months b
y conservative pundits, including Ben Shapiro, who flatly said, “Not everybody s
hould vote.”ADThe wave of voting restrictions introduced in places such as Arizo
na and Georgia, two states that flipped from Trump to the Democratic nominee, Jo
e Biden, in 2020, could set up one of the most significant clashes ahead of next
 year’s midterms, Waldman said.While some of these bills in Arizona and national
ly have gained momentum and could pass, the imposition of new restrictions might
 actually end up inspiring more people to turn out to vote, said Allan Lichtman,
 a distinguished professor of history at American University.“Who is to say what
 is a quality vote?” said Lichtman, author of “The Embattled Vote in America.” “
There is no vote god to define who is casting a quality vote.”Read more:Trump re
