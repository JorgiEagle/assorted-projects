Ada gives John a positive integer N. She challenges him to construct a new number (without leading zeros), that is a
multiple of 9, by inserting exactly one digit (0 â€¦ 9) anywhere in the given number N. It is guaranteed that N does not
have any leading zeros.

As John prefers smaller numbers, he wants to construct the smallest such number possible. Can you help John?
